#   Docker Multi-Stage Build Demo – Node.js App
This project demonstrates the use of **Docker Multi-Stage Builds** to optimize image size and prepare a Node.js application for efficient production deployment.
## Project Overview
I used a simple Node.js app to compare two Docker build strategies :  
- **Basic Dockerfile** – includes everything (dev dependencies, build tools)  
- **Multi-Stage Dockerfile** – production-optimized image with reduced size
